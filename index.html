								<h4>A New Chapter: Focused on Civic Technology @ Code for America</h4>
								<p>After almost 5 years working in Biotech and Healthcare industries developing
									software and
									machine learning products,
									I have recently pivoted into the Civic Technology application space. I am on small a
									team
									building and supporting accessible-first platforms that help low-income individuals
									get
									access to flexible
									cash support.
									<br></br>
									This opportunity has been really exciting to me for a lot of reasons:
								<ul>
									<li>The work we are doing has measurable impacts on poverty alleviation. </li>
									<li>Pilots and programs conducted by Code for America have an impressive history of
										positively influencing
										policies and programs in government to do a better job reaching vulnerable
										populations. </li>
								</ul>
								<b>Working towards equity through technology feels like the best possible use of my
									existing skills</b>, and I'm learning more about social context and engineering here
								everyday.

								<h4>Full-Stack Software Engineer @ Matterworks</h4>
								<p>I boldly joined a ~5 person company (now 15) as their first Software Engineer in
									2021, inspired by their mission to revolutionize a scientific area called
									Metabolomics in
									desparate need of more scalable workflows and data analysis tools. The solutions we
									were building involved combining innovations from software, machine learning, and
									chemistry.
									<br></br>
									I led the effort of designing and implementing multiple software products
									from
									the ground-up in a complex scientific discipline for which I had no prior knowledge
									or understanding. The most notable product I built was an integrated experiment data
									design and capture
									software, which was used daily in the lab to enable much more complex experiments
									than could be done manually, and at scale with traceability built-in.
									<b>These efforts were critical to enable technology development in
										R&D at Matterworks, and to inform future software product
										strategy. </b>

								<h4>Software Engineer in Computational Biology @ ReadCoor / 10x Genomics</h4>
								<p>I continued expanding my knowledge of computer vision and software engineering, while
									exploring a new area
									of
									genomics at ReadCoor and 10x genomics. <br></br>ReadCoor
									spun
									out
									of
									the Wyss Institute at Harvard University to commercialize a novel
									3D-
									fluorescence imaging
									modality called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.191">
										FISSEQ</a>. I helped develop a FISSEQ-specific
									sequencing instrument
									with
									integrated software for
									analyzing cell and tissue samples at sub-cellular resolution. I worked on imaging
									registration
									research, benchmarking, and implementation for stitching together 2D sample images
									into 3D,
									the end-result being localized sequencing run information overlaid onto the 3D
									images.
									I also helped to build a highly reliable and scalable cloud-based software
									infrastructure to run the bioinformatics pipelines that the instrument
									supported.
									Unfortunately, my
									employment was cut short due to an acquisition. </p>

								<h4>Machine Learning Engineer @ Iterative Health</h4>
								<p>Breaking into the startup world in Boston, and getting to work on a
									healthcare-oriented product was my dream! I got to learn from and work alongside
									incredible minds of
									MIT students and faculty, gastroenterologists, and healthcare practitioners <b>to
										improve outcomes in colorectal cancer screening and other gastrointestinal
										diseases through technology.</b>
									<br></br>
									I was mostly focused on building the core ML engine for the flagship product at
									Iterative Scopes called
									<a

									a system which accurately detected and localized colon polyps in real-time. I
									also became
									a very
									proficient Software
									Engineer by building various internal products to support machine learning at
									Iterative Scopes.

								<h4>University of Rochester</h4>
								<h5>September 2013-May 2017 </h5>
								<p>I earned my B.S. in Data Science, Mathematics and Computer Science from the
									University of Rochester. I pursued multiple research opportunities here
									as an undergrad, was a TA for applied statistics courses for 3 years, and was a part
									of the
									first class to graduate
									with this degree. <b>This is where I truly became a multi-disciplinary human and
										researcher. </b> I
									also played squash on the women's club team for 4 years, a Rochester-area and
									University of Rochester favorite sport!
									<br></br>
									If you would like to learn more about my bioinformatics research, <a
										href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-2046">please read my App Note</a>
									that I published with my PI, Dr. Matthew McCall. Or, if you are curious about the
									android app I developed for asthma management with Dr. Wendi
									Heinzelman, you
									can read a little bit about it the <a
										href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7545812">ManageMyCondition
										paper</a>, and a short description
									in an <a
